# Data Visualization Exercise with Matplotlib

## Overview

This repository contains a simple exercise focused on data visualization using Python's Matplotlib library. The task was to recreate similar plots to those provided by the instructor, demonstrating basic data visualization techniques. The exercise covers creating line plots for different types of relationships between variables, including linear and quadratic relationships.


### Objectives
- Practice basic data visualization using Matplotlib.
- Create line plots for different types of relationships between variables.
- Understand how to generate and customize plots in Python.

### Tasks
1. **Importing Libraries**: Import necessary libraries such as Matplotlib and NumPy.
2. **Creating Dummy Data**: Generate simple datasets for plotting.
3. **Plotting Linear Relationships**: Create a line plot to visualize a linear relationship between `x` and `y`.
4. **Plotting Quadratic Relationships**: Create a line plot to visualize a quadratic relationship between `x` and `y`.
5. **Plotting Exponential Relationships**: Create a line plot to visualize an exponential relationship between `x` and `y`.

### Key Concepts
- **Matplotlib**: A powerful plotting library in Python used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations in Python, often used in conjunction with Matplotlib for generating data.
- **Line Plots**: A type of plot that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments.
